# Classifying, storing and exploring flower images

This project aims to produce a flower classification pipeline
using IA libraries (TensorFlow, Pytorch), database tools (SQLAlchemy),
project management tools (Poetry).

See the [streamlit dashboard](https://flower-classifier-db.streamlit.app/) online.

The only use of this project is me getting used to these different tools.
Hopefully the end result can be something cool, but useless.

## Features

- Clean Python project with Poetry
- Use TensorFlow Flowers dataset
- Convert dataset to a DB with SQLAlchemy
- Train a CNN model with PyTorch on this DB
- Explore metadata and model performance with Streamlit
